## Introduction

Thank you very much for being here! First of all, I want to let you know that contributions are more than welcome and really appreciated.

In case you want to contribute, even with a small bug fix, you will be featured into the [credits](https://github.com/JustWhit3/useful-guides/blob/main/README.md#:~:text=on%20VS%20Code.-,Credits,Repository%20leaders,-Gianluca%20Bianco) file.

## How to contribute

To add your contribution, please follow these guidelines:

1) Fork your own copy of the repository.
2) Work on your changes / improvements in the forked repo.
3) **Test** if your changes / improvements are correctly implemented and all the other features are not compromised.
4) Finally, make the pull request.

Once your pull request will be submitted, I will carefully review it and, if it will be considered as an improvement, I will confirm it.

## How to raise an issue

If you find any bug or something you think doesn't work correctly, you are free to open an issue.

Once the issue is received, I will analyze it and once is solved I will respond asking confirmation about my fixing. In this case, if any answer is received in 7 days, the issue will be automatically closed.
