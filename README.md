Here the list of the current folder of the repository:
- [**ROOT**](https://github.com/JustWhit3/useful-guides/tree/main/ROOT): which contains [ROOT](https://github.com/root-project/root) framework guides, and in particular the following sub-folders:
  * ðŸ’¿ [**Installation**](https://github.com/JustWhit3/useful-guides/tree/main/ROOT/Installation): which contains installation guides I wrote for students of the bachelor degree in physics at University of Bologna. These guides have been written by considering all the common issues students had during the framework installation procedure. They are available for the following operating systems: [MacOS](https://github.com/JustWhit3/useful-guides/blob/main/ROOT/Installation/MacOS.md), [Windows](https://github.com/JustWhit3/useful-guides/blob/main/ROOT/Installation/Windows.md) and [Ubuntu](https://github.com/JustWhit3/useful-guides/blob/main/ROOT/Installation/Ubuntu.md). An extra document for ROOT [uninstallation](https://github.com/JustWhit3/useful-guides/blob/main/ROOT/Installation/Uninstall.md) is also provided.
       > Note: in case you have previously installed an old or not working ROOT version, I warmly suggest you to first uninstall it before proceeding with a new one.

       > Hint: if you have to download an Ubuntu release (for example for Windows) it is recommended to download an [LTS](https://ubuntu.com/blog/what-is-an-ubuntu-lts-release) version of it.
  * ðŸ’¥ [**Quick tips**](https://github.com/JustWhit3/useful-guides/tree/main/ROOT/Quick%20tips): which contains tips for ROOT beginners. You can find something related to the following topics:
    - [Compiling and Running](https://github.com/JustWhit3/useful-guides/blob/main/ROOT/Quick%20tips/Compilation%20and%20Running.md): which contains for example some tips about how to compile ROOT macros which depend on other user classes or how to run ROOT macros without entering the ROOT command prompt every time.
    - [ROOT on VS Code](https://github.com/JustWhit3/useful-guides/blob/main/ROOT/Quick%20tips/ROOT%20on%20VS%20Code.md): which explains how to set ROOT framework on VS Code.
